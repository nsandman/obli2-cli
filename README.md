# obli (cli)

Before, you might have had to run two separate servers to give obli all the functionality it needed. Obli 2 plans to eliminate that.

## Dependencies

For this to compile, your system will need the following:

1. libgit2 (tested with v1.0.1)

## Feature Wishlist

1. Collaborative editing of files if you share an organization
2. Cleaner UI
3. Server-side modules should be able to be written in any language
4. Command line-centric interface (both server and browser are started/stopped from the command line)
5. Scripts that can require certain permissions (selenium, etc.) or dispatcher modules
